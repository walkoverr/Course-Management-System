## .gitignore

Ensure this line exists in `.gitignore` to prevent pushing dependencies:

```
node_modules/
```

To remove it from Git:

```bash
git rm -r --cached node_modules
git commit -m "Remove node_modules from Git"
git push origin main
```

Ask for a Postman collection if you want all routes pre-imported for testing.
